# Branch-Ticket-Count-Estimation-with-Pyhton
Objective:
This project aims to estimate the ticket count for a retail branch using historical data. The goal is to develop a model that predicts the number of tickets for a specific branch based on date and time information.

Data Set:
The dataset includes daily ticket sales data for various branches. It contains information such as branch ID, date, time, and ticket count.

Methodology:
The project involves several steps to create a predictive model for ticket count:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
The dataset is cleaned of missing and anomalous values, and formatted for analysis.

Feature Engineering:
Time series data, such as date and time, are processed to create additional features that may impact ticket count predictions.

Modeling:
Various machine learning algorithms are applied to build prediction models, including regression techniques and time series analysis methods.

Model Evaluation:
The performance of the developed models is assessed using various metrics to select the best-performing model.

Outcome:
The project delivers a model capable of effectively predicting ticket counts for a branch. This model will assist retail locations in improving demand forecasting and optimizing inventory management.
